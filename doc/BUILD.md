Compiling
=========

To build `units` 0.2.x, you need sbt 0.13.x.

To compile the code, run `sbt` and execute:

	compile

To package into JARs:

	package

To run the benchmarks:

	benchmark

To run the unit tests:

	test

Prefix the command with a `+` to perform the action for both Scala 2.10 and 2.11.
